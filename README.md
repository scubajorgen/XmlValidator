# XmlValidator

## Introduction
This is a small commandline tool that validates an XML file against the XSD files mentioned in the file itself, 
under the tag ```xsi:schemaLocation```. It downloads the xsd files from internet and validates the XML file against it.

## Usage
To run the application type:

```
java -jar XmlValidator [file to test]
```
where [file to test] is the XML formatted file.

If you run it from the project directory you run a demo by simply typing:

```
java -jar XmlValidator
```

## Result
